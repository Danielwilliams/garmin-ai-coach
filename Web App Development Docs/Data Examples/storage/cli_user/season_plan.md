## Phase Architecture

### Phase 1: STABILIZATION (Weeks 1-4 | Jan 7 – Feb 3)
**Theme:** Build consistency floor, reset autonomic stability  
**Focus Areas:**
- Establish 4-5 training days/week with NO multi-day gaps (eliminate feast-famine pattern)
- Target chronic load progression: 270 → 320 via steady moderate loads (150-250 TSS/week)
- Prioritize sleep hygiene to eliminate zero-REM nights and stabilize >6.5h avg
- Outdoor MTB preference: 2x weekly long rides (2-3hr, IF 0.70-0.75) + 1x Zwift structured intervals

**Success Metrics:** 
- Zero training gaps >2 days | Sleep score avg >72 | RHR trend stable <50 bpm | Chronic load >300 by Week 4

### Phase 2: AEROBIC BASE (Weeks 5-9 | Feb 4 – Mar 10)
**Theme:** Expand aerobic capacity and duration tolerance  
**Focus Areas:**
- Address VO2max stagnation (43-46 plateau) with Zone 2 volume emphasis
- Extend long MTB rides to 3.5-4hr at IF 0.68-0.73 (Royal Gorge duration prep)
- Target chronic load: 320 → 380 with 3:1 load:recovery micro-cycles (mandatory recovery Week 7)
- Introduce 1x weekly tempo threshold block (70-90min, IF 0.85-0.90)

**Success Metrics:**  
- Complete 3x 3.5hr+ MTB sessions | Chronic load >360 | Sleep avg >6.8h | Zero stress days >85

### Phase 3: BUILD (Weeks 10-13 | Mar 11 – Apr 8)
**Theme:** Race-specific intensity for Sprint Series + Sasquatch prep  
**Focus Areas:**
- Week 10-11: Sprint taper prep (VO2max intervals 2x/week, reduce volume)
- **Week 12 (Mar 20):** Sprint Series Race 1 (B-priority)
- Week 13: Transition intensity toward Sasquatch gravel demands (sustained tempo + technical skills)
- Peak chronic load target: 380-400 (do NOT exceed acute 450 per Metrics ceiling)
- **Mandatory deload Week 11** to protect recovery reserve before sprint taper

**Success Metrics:**  
- Sprint Series completion <1:20 | No zero-REM nights during build | HRV >50 maintained

---

### Phase 4: SPECIFIC PREPARATION (Weeks 14-17 | Apr 9 – May 6)
**Theme:** Royal Gorge race simulation and endurance consolidation  
**Focus Areas:**
- **Week 14 (Apr 11):** Sasquatch Duro (A-priority, 3hr) as Royal Gorge rehearsal
- Weeks 15-16: 1x weekly 4-5hr MTB at race IF (0.68-0.72) + technical feature practice
- Introduce back-to-back long days (Fri 3hr + Sat 4hr) to simulate fatigue resistance
- 2:1 load:recovery pattern (hard weeks 15 & 17, recovery Week 16)
- Outdoor priority for all key sessions (indoor risk per Activity analysis)

**Success Metrics:**  
- Sasquatch completion <3:15 | 2x 4.5hr+ MTB sessions executed | Sleep >6.5h floor maintained

---

### Phase 5: TAPER (Weeks 18-19 | May 7 – May 15)
**Theme:** Sharpen and arrive fresh  
**Focus Areas:**
- Reduce volume 40% Week 18, 60% Week 19
- Maintain intensity anchors: 1x threshold (60min), 1x short VO2 intervals
- Sleep prioritization: target 7.5h+ avg, HRV >55, RHR <48
- Final race-prep MTB session Week 18 (2hr, technical focus)

**Success Metrics:**  
- Arrive at Royal Gorge with RHR <48, HRV >58, sleep score >80 | Race execution 5:45-6:15

## Expert Integration Rationale

### Metrics Insights Applied:
- **Volatility Risk:** Eliminated via mandatory consistency targets (no >2 day gaps) and 2:1/3:1 micro-cycles instead of athlete's historical feast-famine blocks
- **Chronic Load Stagnation:** Addressed through progressive ceiling targets (270→320→380→400) with conservative acute load caps (<450)
- **VO2max Plateau:** 8-week aerobic base phase (Weeks 5-9 + partial Weeks 1-4) to restart aerobic adaptation

### Activity Insights Applied:
- **Proven Sessions Prioritized:** Long MTB (athlete's strength), threshold blocks (70-90min), Zwift intervals as phase-appropriate anchors
- **Outdoor Preference:** Scheduled outdoor priority for key sessions to reduce dropout risk from indoor positioning discomfort
- **Duration Feasibility:** Current 3hr IF 0.79 capability directly informs 6hr race target at IF 0.68-0.72 via progressive extension

### Physiology Insights Applied:
- **Recovery Fragility:** 2:1 and 3:1 load:recovery cycles (vs. traditional 3:1/4:1) to prevent autonomic collapse
- **Sleep Architecture Priority:** Zero-REM nights as phase abort criteria; stabilization phase prerequisite before loading
- **Post-Surgical Constraint:** 20-30% longer adaptation phases (4-week stabilization vs. typical 2-3 weeks)
- **Stress Redlining:** Mandatory recovery weeks after high-stress blocks to reset chronic 95-99 stress pattern

## Qualitative Constraints

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Training gaps >2 consecutive days trigger phase regression
- Zero-REM nights >1/week = immediate deload insertion
- Outdoor long rides cannot be substituted with indoor equivalents during Phases 4-5
- Acute load ceiling = 450 TSS until chronic load stabilizes >350 for 3+ weeks

**Adaptation Signals:**
- GREEN: Proceed as planned | Sleep >7h, HRV >55, RHR <49
- YELLOW: Execute planned recovery week early | Sleep 6-7h, HRV 48-55, RHR 49-51
- RED: Force 5-7 day low-stress block | Sleep <6h, HRV <48, RHR >51, any zero-REM night

**Race Day Predictions:**
- **Sprint Series (Mar 20):** Likely 1:12-1:18 finish based on Week 10-11 VO2 prep
- **Sasquatch (Apr 11):** 2:50-3:10 range; serves as Royal Gorge validation
- **Royal Gorge (May 16):** 5:45-6:15 achievable IF Phases 1-4 execute without major disruptions
